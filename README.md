# LinkedIn Viewer Bot
Iterates through the peoples tag on LinkedIn in order to get profile views up. It uses time as a seed in both the navigation and random individual along the list array in order to avoid the LinkedIn bot detected. This got me %2000 views up from the previous week. In order to really take advantage of this though the individual will require premium as LinkedIn has a limitation on the number of individuals you can view from the sidebar. Future renditions will find a way around this.

## Usage
Copy the folder to a chrome extensions tab and enable developer mode. Then simply navigate to a page which has the sidebar. Then type in the number of iterations you wish to proceed with then click on the face to start.
